# dataanalysis-bestplacestolive

### Brief
Utilised data science principles to analyse the 2011 UK census data set to create part of a model that determines the best places to live.

### Abstract
The project we embarked on was to determine the political, social, and economic situation of constituencies
by look at data that was collected from the constituency dashboard on the Parliament website
and Census data. Each group member looked at a different aspect of these questions so that we would
get an overall view on what features of a constituency influenced it the most and use this to decide where
to live. The team all used at least one of the following methods: Ordinary Linear Regression, Logistic
Regression, Decision Trees. After each member had conducted their analysis, the results were that it was
possible to get a picture of the factors in question (accuracy of all models was above 0.8). Most factors
could be well predicted with fewer than 5 features and the most features in a final model was 10.

### Conclusion
Conclusion
Combined, the team has created a series of models
that accurately predict the major characteristics of
a constituency: political leanings, unemployment,
and the number of businesses per capita. Logistic
regression was the primary base used throughout
as choosing whether or not to live in a constituency
is a binary decision. The study prioritised having a lower number of
false positives so constituencies identified by the
models as ideal, had a higher likelihood of being
ideal in reality.
In conclusion, the predictive models classified
constituents as ideal and unideal effectively. In
practice, they would be combined to create an algorithm
where individuals have the power to define
whether more or less of a feature is ideal for them
and returns a list of constituents.
